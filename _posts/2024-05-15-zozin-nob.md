## Nob (no build) build system

**NAME** : nob\
**GENERAL CONCEPT** : Build script written in the same language as the code that's being compiled\
**PROBLEM SOLVED** : Using too many languages/syntaxes\
**REPLACING** : make, cmake\
\
Do your build directly in C code instead of using other tools, like make.\
\
First you'll need nob.h.\
Then write your nob.c script.\
\
Get [nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/musializer/blob/master/src/nob.h)\
Get sample [nob.c](https://github.com/tsoding/musializer/blob/master/src/nob_linux.c)\
