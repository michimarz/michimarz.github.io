## Fundamentals

Libs can be:\
- static\
- dynamic\
\
Static:\
- faster execution\
- bigger executable\
- not secure\
- not shared between applications\
- may not work with other libs versions -> guaranteed to work only on the machine you compiled and linked you app on\
\
Dynamic:\
- slower\
- separated from an executable\
- shared between applications\
- can be opened and used from the code on runtime -> that enables hot reloading\
\
