## Fundamentals

Libs can be:
- static
- dynamic

Static:
- faster execution
- bigger executable
- not secure
- not shared between applications
- may not work with other libs versions -> guaranteed to work only on the machine you compiled and linked you app on

Dynamic:
- slower
- separated from an executable
- shared between applications
- can be opened and used from the code on runtime -> that enables hot reloading

## Linking

We'll need a library to be installed locally on my system to make GCC locate it during compilation and linking. 
When installed, the library will be available in a standard location (system library path) like `/lib`, `/usr/lib` or `/usr/lib64`.\
Otherwise, we'll need to help GCC locate it by providing the path to it:

```shell
$ gcc -L./lib -o myApp my_app.c -lexample
```

**-L option**: give an additional path to search locations\
**-l option**: give a name of the library you want to use (link against)

## Troubleshooting

We check which dynamic libraries have been linked by using a ldd tool:

```shell
$ ldd ./myApp
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe151df000)
        libexample.so => not found
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f514b60a000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f514b839000)
```

## LD_LIBRARY_PATH

We can use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to define the path to libraries.

```shell
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib myApp
Hello World!
```

That doesn't require us to rebuild an executable.
On the other hand, it breaks when we move the library or the executable.

## rpath

What the -L option does at link time, the -rpath option does at run time.

```shell
$ gcc -Wl,-rpath=/opt/Something/lib ...
```

When we do this, the search path will be built into the executable.

On Linux we can also use the $ORIGIN variable to make the path relative to the executable:

```shell
$ gcc -Wl,-rpath=\$ORIGIN/lib ...
$ gcc '-Wl,-rpath=$ORIGIN/lib' ...
```
