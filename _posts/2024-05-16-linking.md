## Fundamentals

Libs can be:
- static
- dynamic

Static:
- faster execution
- bigger executable
- not secure
- not shared between applications
- may not work with other libs versions -> guaranteed to work only on the machine you compiled and linked you app on

Dynamic:
- slower
- separated from an executable
- shared between applications
- can be opened and used from the code on runtime -> that enables hot reloading\
