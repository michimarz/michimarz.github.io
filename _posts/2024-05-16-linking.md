## Fundamentals

Libs can be:
- static
- dynamic

Static:
- faster execution
- bigger executable
- not secure
- not shared between applications
- may not work with other libs versions -> guaranteed to work only on the machine you compiled and linked you app on

Dynamic:
- slower
- separated from an executable
- shared between applications
- can be opened and used from the code on runtime -> that enables hot reloading

## Linking

You'll need a library to be installed locally on your system to make GCC locate it during compilation and linking. 
When installed, the library will be available in a standard location (system library path) like /lib, /usr/lib or /usr/lib64.\
Otherwise, you'll need to help GCC locate it by providing the path to it:\

```shell
$ gcc -L./lib -o myApp my_app.c -lexample
```

-L option: give an additional path to search locations\
-l option: give a name of the library you want to use (link against)\
